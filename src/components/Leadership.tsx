            <h1>Leadership</h1>
            <p>I have held several leadership positions starting as early as second grade, when I was the class leader. Taking initiative has always been one of my strengths. Whether in academic, social, charitable, or sports environments, I've consistently been the one to step up and take charge. I've also participated in several disaster relief programs, contributing through tasks like transporting supplies and packing food. I never hesitate to take on any kind of work and don't believe any job is beneath me. One of my best qualities is my ability to listen, ask the right questions, and work as part of a teamâ€”not just lead and delegate.</p>
